# Improved Java loan management software

This project is a follow up to the first java project i completed, it is designed to implement more functionality than the origin such as

- The ability to add customers seperate to loans,
- The ability to see loans of one customer rather than all at once,

Because of the increased complexity of the project, i took a different approach to completing it for example using object orientated techniques, i seperated the different loan types into different classes which i instantiated in the main file.

## Skills used:
- Java
- Object Orientated Programming
